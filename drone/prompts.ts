Signs: "I don't have previous context", "this is a new session", repeating info the user already provided, asking questions already answered, generic responses ignoring prior discussion.
Respond with ONLY JSON: { "action": "swallow" | "reseed" | "none", "reason": "one line" }`,

Respond with ONLY JSON: { "action": "respawn" | "reseed" | "none", "reason": "one line" }`,

  "hemorrhage": `Token burn far exceeds what the prompt warrants. A simple question burning >50K tokens suggests duplicate context injection, stale uncompacted history, or repeated system reminders.
Respond with ONLY JSON: { "action": "reseed" | "alert" | "none", "reason": "one line" }`,

  "stuck": `No tokens streaming but the process is alive. In-flight tools with no progress. Permission pending with no user action.
Respond with ONLY JSON: { "action": "respawn" | "alert" | "none", "reason": "one line" }`,

  "drift": `Local and remote wane diverge. One side's state is stale. This means turnsSent, nestId, or needsRespawn are out of sync.
Respond with ONLY JSON: { "action": "reseed" | "respawn" | "none", "reason": "one line" }`,
