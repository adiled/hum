    description: `The ONE filesystem analysis tool. It discovers, studies, and searches — replacing any line-based read, any glob, any grep. No offset, no limit, no pagination.

Works on ANY file: code (tree-sitter symbol outline), configs/docs (anchor outline), extensionless files (Dockerfile, Makefile, LICENSE, lockfiles), unknown extensions (.lock, .bin, .xyz) — all return content. Never refuses based on extension. Binary is decoded as UTF-8 (replacement chars in gaps).

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
QUICKSTART — five concrete tasks and the exact call:
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
1. "What's in this file?"
     → read('/abs/path/daemon.ts')
     returns: file stats + first 20 lines + full symbol outline + hints

2. "Show me the foo() function"
     → read('/abs/path/daemon.ts', symbol: 'foo')
     returns: just foo's source, line-numbered

3. "Find every trace() call in daemon.ts"
     → read('/abs/path/daemon.ts', pattern: 'trace\\\\(')
     returns: every matching line with its enclosing symbol,
              e.g. "daemon.ts:82 [function ClaudeNest.awaken] trace(…"

4. "Find all handlers across src/"
     → read('/abs/path/src', query: 'handle')
     recursively fuzzy-matches symbol names across the whole tree

5. "What .py tests exist?"
     → read('/abs/path/**/test_*.py')
     glob expands, returns one-line inventory per file

6. "Show me this Dockerfile / Makefile / lockfile"
     → read('/abs/path/Dockerfile')
     extensionless and unknown-extension files work identically

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
path semantics (auto-detected):
  /abs/path/file           → single file
  /abs/path/dir            → walks the tree (skips node_modules, .git, …)
  /abs/path/**/glob.pattern → glob expands (detected by * or ?)

modifiers (pick at most one, mutually exclusive):
  symbol: 'X'     exact symbol by name. Dot-nested: 'Class.method'.
  query:  'sub'   fuzzy substring match on symbol NAMES.
  pattern: 'regex' regex on file CONTENT. For code, each match carries
                   its enclosing function/class symbol.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
RULES:
- No offset, no limit, no line numbers in the request — that is not
  how an agent should interact with code. If you catch yourself
  wanting "lines 400-800 of X", you want read(X, symbol: 'SomeFunc')
  or read(X, pattern: 'thing-I-was-looking-for').
- Start with the modifier-free call read(path) ONLY when you don't
  know the file yet. If you already know what you want, go straight
  to symbol/pattern/query — the modifier-free call is slower.
- AST-backed code: ts/tsx/js/jsx/py/go/rs. Other files get plain
  line-based regex for pattern and full content for the default read.
- Always print the tool result to the user — they cannot see it
  directly.
- This tool is self-sufficient. Do NOT reach for bash ls/find/grep/
  cat/head/tail — they are hard-banned and will be rejected with a
  redirect back to this tool.`,

    description: `Author code. You are writing code — think like a developer in the target language.

COMMON SENSE — apply these every time, don't wait to be told:
  - IMPORTS: if your new code references a module, type, or function that isn't already imported, add the import. Don't write code that won't compile because an import is missing.
  - STYLE: read the file first. Match the existing conventions — semicolons or not, single quotes or double, tabs or spaces, trailing commas. Don't impose your own preference on someone else's codebase.
  - TYPES: if the file is TypeScript, write TypeScript. If it's Python with type hints, add type hints. Don't downgrade typed code to untyped because you're being lazy.
  - NAMING: camelCase in JS/TS, snake_case in Python/Rust/Ruby, PascalCase for classes everywhere. Follow the language's conventions, not a generic one.
  - COMPLETENESS: don't write placeholder comments like "// implement this" or "# TODO". Write the actual implementation. If you can't implement it, say so in your response, don't hide it in a comment.
  - ERROR HANDLING: if the existing code handles errors (try/catch, Result types, error returns), your new code should too. Don't add a function that ignores errors when every neighbor handles them.
  - SCOPE: change what was asked. Don't refactor neighboring code, don't "clean up" imports you didn't touch, don't add features that weren't requested.

LANGUAGE COVERAGE (AST-grounded — re-parsed, symbol-scoped edits work):
  .ts .tsx .js .jsx .mjs .cjs  .py .pyi  .go  .rs  .java  .c .h
  .cc .cpp .cxx .hpp .hxx  .rb  .php  .cs  .sh .bash  .vue
  Also accepted (text-only, no symbol ops): .kt .kts .swift .scala .lua .zsh .fish .svelte .sql
  Anything else → use do_noncode.

OPERATIONS:
  create           — new file. Syntax-validated before write.
  replace + symbol — splice one symbol. Pass the FULL new source of that symbol.
  replace (no sym) — whole-file rewrite. Use only when most lines are changing.
  insert_after/before — add code adjacent to a symbol anchor.
  delete           — remove a symbol.

IMPORTS: the top-of-file import block is addressable as symbol: 'imports' — a synthetic symbol that spans the first contiguous run of import/use/#include/using directives. Prefer 'replace' with the full new block for add/remove/reorder (clean output, no stray blank lines). insert_after/before also work but leave a blank-line separator. delete nukes the whole block. Covered: TS/JS, Python, Go, Rust, Java, C/C++, C#, PHP. Not covered: Ruby, shell, Vue — on those, symbol 'imports' is not found and you should whole-file replace.

ADDRESSABLE in JS/TS (and Vue <script>): functions, classes, methods, top-level const/let/var, type aliases, enums, the synthetic 'imports' block. Yes — top-level "const foo = ref(...)", "const URL = '…'", "let counter", "type Foo", "enum Status" are all addressable by name. Don't fall back to whole-file rewrite for "I have nothing to anchor on" — read the outline first; the const/type/enum is in there.

VUE SFCs: don't treat the <script> block as a monolith. Read it once to see its child outline, then address by symbol like a normal .ts file. Sub-block syntax:
  - script.<name>          — JS/TS symbol inside <script> (function, class, const, type, enum, …).
  - template.<tag>         — first <tag> in template (use #N if multiple).
  - template.<tag>#<id>    — element with that static id attr (e.g. template.div#banner).
  - style.<class>          — CSS class rule. Single class .foo => style.foo. Compound .foo.bar => style.foo.bar.
  - style.#<id>            — CSS id rule (e.g. style.#hero).
  - style.<parent>.<child> — nested SCSS resolves through the tree.
  - style.@media (…)       — at-rules (@media/@supports/@keyframes) are addressable; nested rules nest inside.
  Read template/style first to see the child outline before drilling.

WORKFLOW: read(file) first → see symbol outline (includes 'imports' if present) → do_code(file, symbol, new_source). The read is required (staleness guard). After editing, verify with read(file, symbol: 'name').`,

PHRASE — address by structural name OR quote exact text. Format-aware.
  For structural names (keys, headings, env vars): the name stays, its governed scope is replaced.
  For exact text: the quoted span is replaced directly.
  do_noncode(file, phrase: 'DATABASE_URL', replace: 'postgres://new/db')

  do_noncode(file, phrase: '[database]', replace: 'host = new\\nport = 5432\\n')
  do_noncode(file, phrase: '"tool_call": true', replace: '"tool_call": false')

SENTENCE — quote text within a sentence. Scope expands to the smallest independent unit.
  JSON: comma-delimited entry. YAML: sibling key + children. Env/TOML/Markdown: single line.
  do_noncode(file, sentence: 'port = 3000', replace: 'port = 9090')

PARAGRAPH — quote text within a paragraph. Scope expands to the full block.
